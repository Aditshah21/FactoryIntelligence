# FactoryIntelligence
Portal which helps you to control the factory with help of Object Detection!

Hey Guys,

First of all let me clear with all files as there are way too many files in this repo.
So this portal is basically running on Spring Framework along with its security and merged with Python.
Python is used for machine learning algorithm to train a neural network for Object Classfication.

I have uploaded all files along with datasets for training network. You can also increase your dataset for more accuracy!

Java Folders--->WebContent, src and build.
Remaining ones are for Python.

For understanding python code for training a neural network, search on Google for LeNet!

I hope that's everything from my side.
Make sure you have Anacode installed and several other things like Tomcat,Eclipse etc.

Enjoy!
